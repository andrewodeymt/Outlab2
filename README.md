# Outlab2

put   put a new key-value pair into the data structure\
get   return the value for a given key (or null if key not present)\
floor return the largest key in the data structure that is <= to the given key (or null)\
ceiling return the smallest key in the data structure that is >= to the given key (or null)\
show  a method that prints all key-value pairs stored, in order\

You should also implement a simple user interface to test the code.  Here is a sample interaction:\

java MyBST\
Welcome to my MyBST!\
Here are the commands you can use:\
(p)ut key value\
(g)et key\
(f)loor key\
(c)eiling key\
(s)how tree printed key-value pairs, in order\
(r)emove key\
e(x)it\
